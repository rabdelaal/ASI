### Task Execution

#### 1. Check for GitHub Credentials in `.env` File

```powershell
# Navigate to the parent directory
cd ..

# Read the .env file and extract GitHub credentials
$envFileContent = Get-Content -Path ".\.env" -Raw
$githubCredentials = [regex]::Matches($envFileContent, 'GITHUB_USERNAME=(.*?)\nGITHUB_TOKEN=(.*?)\n') | ForEach-Object {
    [PSCustomObject]@{
        Username = $_.Groups[1].Value
        Token = $_.Groups[2].Value
    }
}

# Navigate back to the current directory
cd -
```

#### 2. Check if the Repository is Up-to-Date

```powershell
# Fetch the latest changes from the remote repository
git fetch origin

# Check if the local branch is up-to-date
$behindCount = git rev-list --count HEAD..origin/main
if ($behindCount -gt 0) {
    Write-Host "Your local branch is behind the remote branch by $behindCount commits."
} else {
    Write-Host "Your local branch is up-to-date with the remote branch."
}
```

#### 3. Commit and Push Changes

```powershell
# Check if there are any changes to commit
$changes = git status --porcelain
if ($changes) {
    # Stage all changes
    git add .

    # Commit changes
    git commit -m "Update changes"

    # Push changes to the remote repository
    git push origin main
} else {
    Write-Host "No changes to commit."
}
```

### Monitoring and Follow-Up

```

### Monitoring and Follow-Up
Context: 1. can you confirm that the `../.env` file exists and contains the necessary github credentials?
**Check for GitHub Credentials in `.env` File**
   - Locate and read the `.env` file in the parent directory (`../.env`).
   - Extract the GitHub credentials.
**Verify the Removal of Secrets**
   - After removing the commits, verify that the secrets are no longer present in the repository.
**Update Documentation**
   - Update the README or any other documentation to reflect the changes made and the steps taken to remove the secrets.

Would you like to proceed with the execution of these tasks? If so, please confirm, and I will run the Python and PowerShell scripts.
**Remove Commits with Secrets**
   - Identify commits that contain secrets.
   - Remove these commits from the local and remote repositories.

### Task Execution

#### 1. Check for GitHub Credentials in `.env` File

```python
import os

def read_env_file(file_path):
    if not os.path.exists(file_path):
        return None
    
    with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
        lines = file.readlines()
    
    credentials = {}
    for line in lines:
        key, value = line.strip().split('=', 1)
        credentials[key] = value
    
    return credentials

# Path to the .env file
env_file_path = '../.env'
github_credentials = read_env_file(env_file_path)

if github_credentials:
    print("GitHub credentials found in .env file:")
    print(github_credentials)
else:
    print("No .env file found or no GitHub credentials in the file.")
```

#### 2. Check Current Directory for Updates

```powershell
# Navigate to the current directory
cd .

# Check if the repository is up to date
git fetch origin
git status
```

#### 3. Remove Commits with Secrets

```powershell
# Identify commits with secrets
# This is a simplified example; you may need to adjust the grep pattern
git log --grep="secret" --oneline

# Remove identified commits
# Note: This is a destructive operation. Ensure you have a backup before proceeding.
# Replace <commit_hash> with the actual commit hash
# git rebase -i <commit_hash>^
# git push --force
```

### Follow-up
**Check Current Directory for Updates**
   - Navigate to the current directory.
   - Check if the repository is up to date with the remote repository.
**Backup Before Force Pushing**
   - Ensure you have a backup of the repository before force pushing changes to avoid data loss.
**Check for GitHub Credentials in Current Directory**:
   - Read the `.env` file in the current directory.
   - Extract any GitHub-related credentials.
**Review and Update Repository Permissions**: Ensure that only authorized users have access to the repository.
**Set Up Git Hooks**: Implement pre-commit hooks to prevent accidental commits of sensitive information.
**Update README to Exclude Secrets**: Ensure that the README file does not contain any instructions or references to secrets.
**Review and Secure Other Configuration Files**: Check other configuration files (e.g., `.json`, `.yaml`) for any sensitive information.
**Remove Commits Containing Secrets**:
   - Identify and remove any commits that contain the extracted GitHub credentials.

### Execution Plan

#### Task 1: Check for GitHub Credentials in Current Directory
```python
import os

    credentials = {}
    for line in lines:
        if line.startswith('GITHUB_'):
            key, value = line.strip().split('=', 1)
            credentials[key] = value
    
    return credentials

current_dir = os.getcwd()
env_file_path = os.path.join(current_dir, '.env')

github_credentials = read_env_file(env_file_path)
if github_credentials:
    print("GitHub credentials found in .env:")
    for key, value in github_credentials.items():
        print(f"{key}: {value}")
else:
    print("No GitHub credentials found in .env.")
```

#### Task 2: Check for Up-to-Date Files
```powershell
# Navigate to the current directory
cd $PSScriptRoot

# Fetch the latest changes from the remote repository
git fetch origin

# Check the status of the local repository
git status

# Pull the latest changes from the remote repository
git pull origin main
```

#### Task 3: Remove Commits Containing Secrets
```powershell
# Navigate to the current directory
cd $PSScriptRoot

# List all commits containing the secret
$secret = "YOUR_SECRET_HERE"  # Replace with the actual secret
git log --all --grep="$secret" --oneline

# Reset the branch to a commit before the secret was added
# Replace 'commit_hash' with the hash of the commit before the secret was added
git reset --hard commit_hash

# Force push to update the remote repository
git push --force
```

### Follow-Up Tasks

# ASI Project Presentation

## Overview
The ASI (Autonomous System Integration) project aims to develop an advanced autonomous agent capable of performing complex tasks with minimal human intervention. This project leverages cutting-edge technologies in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and natural language processing to create a robust and efficient system.

## Features
- **Task Automation**: The agent can break down complex tasks into simpler sub-tasks and execute them efficiently.
- **Context Maintenance**: It maintains context across multiple interactions to ensure coherent and relevant responses.
- **File Operations**: Capable of performing various file operations such as reading, writing, and managing files.
- **System Operations**: Executes system-level commands to manage the environment effectively.
- **GitHub Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with GitHub for version control and collaboration.

## Usage
To use the ASI agent, simply provide it with a task or command, and it will handle the rest. For example:
```shell
# To create and execute a task
ASI create_task "Update README.md with project details"
```
