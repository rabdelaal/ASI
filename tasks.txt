### Task 1: Check for GitHub Credentials in `../.env`

#### Step 1.1: Read the `.env` file
We will read the contents of the `../.env` file to check for GitHub credentials.

```python
# For Python code
import os

def check_github_credentials(env_file_path):
    if not os.path.exists(env_file_path):
        print(f"File {env_file_path} does not exist.")
        return None

    with open(env_file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
        content = file.readlines()

    github_credentials = {}
    for line in content:
        if line.startswith('GITHUB_'):
            key, value = line.strip().split('=', 1)
            github_credentials[key] = value

    return github_credentials

env_file_path = '../.env'
credentials = check_github_credentials(env_file_path)

if credentials:
    print("GitHub credentials found:")
    for key, value in credentials.items():
        print(f"{key}: {value}")
else:
    print("No GitHub credentials found.")
```

### Task 2: Commit and Push Pending Changes

#### Step 2.1: Stage, Commit, and Push Changes
We will use PowerShell to stage, commit, and push any pending changes.

```powershell
# For shell commands
git add .
git commit -m "Commit and push pending changes"
git push origin main
```

### Task 3: Improve and Use SHADCN for UI in `index.html`

#### Step 3.1: Install SHADCN
First, we need to install SHADCN if it's not already installed.

```powershell
# For shell commands
npm install shadcn
```

#### Step 3.2: Update `index.html` with SHADCN
We will update the `index.html` file to include SHADCN styles and components.

```python
# For Python code
import os

def update_index_html_with_shadcn(index_html_path):
    if not os.path.exists(index_html_path):
        print(f"File {index_html_path} does not exist.")
        return

    with open(index_html_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
        content = file.read()

    # Add SHADCN styles and scripts
    updated_content = content.replace(
        '</head>',
        '<link rel="stylesheet" href="node_modules/shadcn/dist/index.css">\n</head>'
    )
    updated_content = updated_content.replace(
        '</body>',
        '<script src="node_modules/shadcn/dist/index.js"></script>\n</body>'
    )

    with open(index_html_path, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as file:
        file.write(updated_content)

    print(f"Updated {index_html_path} with SHADCN.")

index_html_path = 'index.html'
update_index_html_with_shadcn(index_html_path)
```
