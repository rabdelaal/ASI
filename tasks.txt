**Check for GitHub Credentials in `.env` File**
   - Navigate to the parent directory and read the `.env` file to extract GitHub credentials.
**Check if the Repository is Up-to-Date**
   - Use Git commands to check if the local repository is up-to-date with the remote repository.
**Navigate Back to the Current Directory**
   - Return to the original directory after reading the `.env` file.
**Commit and Push Changes**
   - If there are changes, commit them with a message and push to the remote repository.

### Task Execution

#### 1. Check for GitHub Credentials in `.env` File

```powershell
# Navigate to the parent directory
cd ..

# Read the .env file and extract GitHub credentials
$envFileContent = Get-Content -Path ".\.env" -Raw
$githubCredentials = [regex]::Matches($envFileContent, 'GITHUB_USERNAME=(.*?)\nGITHUB_TOKEN=(.*?)\n') | ForEach-Object {
    [PSCustomObject]@{
        Username = $_.Groups[1].Value
        Token = $_.Groups[2].Value
    }
}

# Navigate back to the current directory
cd -
```

#### 2. Check if the Repository is Up-to-Date

```powershell
# Fetch the latest changes from the remote repository
git fetch origin

# Check if the local branch is up-to-date
$behindCount = git rev-list --count HEAD..origin/main
if ($behindCount -gt 0) {
    Write-Host "Your local branch is behind the remote branch by $behindCount commits."
} else {
    Write-Host "Your local branch is up-to-date with the remote branch."
}
```

#### 3. Commit and Push Changes

```powershell
# Check if there are any changes to commit
$changes = git status --porcelain
if ($changes) {
    # Stage all changes
    git add .

    # Commit changes
    git commit -m "Update changes"

    # Push changes to the remote repository
    git push origin main
} else {
    Write-Host "No changes to commit."
}
```

### Monitoring and Follow-Up

- **Monitoring**: The script will output messages indicating the status of the repository and the actions taken.
- **Follow-Up**: If the repository is not up-to-date, the user may need to pull the latest changes before pushing their own changes.

Retry task - **Check for GitHub Credentials in `.env` File**
   - Navigate to the parent directory and read the `.env` file to extract GitHub credentials.
Context: 1. can you provide the correct path to the child directory?
Retry task - **Check if the Repository is Up-to-Date**
   - Use Git commands to check if the local repository is up-to-date with the remote repository.
Context: would you like to proceed with removing the secrets from the commits or allowing them via the url? also, do you want to add and commit the `tasks.txt` file?
