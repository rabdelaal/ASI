# Navigate to the parent directory
cd ..

# Read the .env file and extract GitHub-related information
$envContent = Get-Content -Path .env
$githubInfo = $envContent | Where-Object { $_ -match "GITHUB" }

# Display the extracted GitHub information
$githubInfo
```

#### 2. Improve `README.md`

```python
import os

# Define the path to the README.md file
readme_path = os.path.join('ASI', 'README.md')

# Read the existing content of the README.md
with open(readme_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
    readme_content = file.read()

# Add more detailed information and emojis
improved_content = f"""{readme_content}
